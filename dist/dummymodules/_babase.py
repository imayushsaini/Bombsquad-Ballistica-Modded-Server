class ContextCall:
    """A context-preserving callable.

    Category: **General Utility Classes**

    A ContextCall wraps a callable object along with a reference
    to the current context (see babase.ContextRef); it handles restoring
    the context when run and automatically clears itself if the context
    it belongs to dies.

    Generally you should not need to use this directly; all standard
    Ballistica callbacks involved with timers, materials, UI functions,
    etc. handle this under-the-hood so you don't have to worry about it.
    The only time it may be necessary is if you are implementing your
    own callbacks, such as a worker thread that does some action and then
    runs some game code when done. By wrapping said callback in one of
    these, you can ensure that you will not inadvertently be keeping the
    current activity alive or running code in a torn-down (expired)
    context_ref.

    You can also use babase.WeakCall for similar functionality, but
    ContextCall has the added bonus that it will not run during context_ref
    shutdown, whereas babase.WeakCall simply looks at whether the target
    object instance still exists.

    ##### Examples
    **Example A:** code like this can inadvertently prevent our activity
    (self) from ending until the operation completes, since the bound
    method we're passing (self.dosomething) contains a strong-reference
    to self).
    >>> start_some_long_action(callback_when_done=self.dosomething)

    **Example B:** in this case our activity (self) can still die
    properly; the callback will clear itself when the activity starts
    shutting down, becoming a harmless no-op and releasing the reference
    to our activity.

    >>> start_long_action(
    ...     callback_when_done=babase.ContextCall(self.mycallback))
    """

    def __init__(self, call: Callable) -> None:

class ContextRef:
    """Store or use a ballistica context.

    Category: **General Utility Classes**

    Many operations such as bascenev1.newnode() or bascenev1.gettexture()
    operate implicitly on a current 'context'. A context is some sort of
    state that functionality can implicitly use. Context determines, for
    example, which scene nodes or textures get added to without having to
    specify it explicitly in the newnode()/gettexture() call. Contexts can
    also affect object lifecycles; for example a babase.ContextCall will
    become a no-op when the context it was created in is destroyed.

    In general, if you are a modder, you should not need to worry about
    contexts; mod code should mostly be getting run in the correct
    context and timers and other callbacks will take care of saving
    and restoring contexts automatically. There may be rare cases,
    however, where you need to deal directly with contexts, and that is
    where this class comes in.

    Creating a babase.ContextRef() will capture a reference to the current
    context. Other modules may provide ways to access their contexts; for
    example a bascenev1.Activity instance has a 'context' attribute. You
    can also use babase.ContextRef.empty() to create a reference to *no*
    context. Some code such as UI calls may expect this and may complain
    if you try to use them within a context.

    ##### Usage
    ContextRefs are generally used with the Python 'with' statement, which
    sets the context they point to as current on entry and resets it to
    the previous value on exit.

    ##### Example
    Explicitly create a few UI bits with no context set.
    (UI stuff may complain if called within a context):
    >>> with bui.ContextRef.empty():
    ...     my_container = bui.containerwidget()
